h1. !http://railsapps.github.io/images/rails-36x36.jpg(Rails Bootstrap)! Rails and Bootstrap

Rails 4.1 example application that integrates Rails and Bootstrap 3.1.

"Bootstrap":http://getbootstrap.com/ (formerly Twitter Bootstrap) provides CSS stylesheets and JavaScript code for the visual design of websites. Bootstrap is a framework for client-side (browser-based or “front end”) development, much like Ruby on Rails is a framework for server-side development.

Use this example application as a starter app for your own web applications.

You can build this application in only a few minutes using the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool.

h2. Resources for Rails and Bootstrap

h2. What Is Implemented -- and What Is Not

The example application can be used as the basis for any website. It shows the simplest approach to implementing a website, using practices recommended by experienced Rails developers. With knowledge of Rails, the website can be adapted and customized to your needs. Features include:

* Home page
* "About" page
* Navigation bar

h4. Additional Pages

The application uses the "high_voltage gem":https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage for the "About" page. Additional pages can easily be added. The high_voltage gem makes it easy to add pages with static content (text that doesn't change) incorporating elements of a site-wide application layout such as header, navigation links, and footer.

For example, using the high_voltage gem, you could add pages for:

* FAQ
* News
* Legal disclaimers

h4. Database

The application does not require a database. No pages are generated using information from a database and no user-submitted data is saved to a database. However, the sqlite3 gem is included in the Gemfile so Rails ActiveRecord can be used to add database functionality to the web application.

h4. Tutorial Application

Additional features implemented in the tutorial include:

* Image carousel
* Survey form
* Google spreadsheet datastore
* Modal window

These features demonstrate how Bootstrap can be used with Rails but are not needed in a starter application.

h4. SimpleForm Issues

Developers often use the "SimpleForm":http://simple-form.plataformatec.com.br/ gem with Rails. SimpleForm integrates with Bootstrap 2.3. Unfortunately, SimpleForm does not fully support Bootstrap 3 (see "issues":https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form/pull/864).

h2. Similar Examples and Tutorials

This is one in a series of Rails example apps and tutorials from the "RailsApps Project":http://railsapps.github.io/. See a list of additional "Rails examples, tutorials, and starter apps":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-examples-tutorials.html. Related example applications may be useful:

* "Learn Rails":https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails companion to the book "Learn Ruby on Rails":http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html
* "Foundation and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-foundation/ shows how to integrate Foundation
* "OmniAuth and Rails":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-omniauth uses OmniAuth for authentication
* "Devise and Rails":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-devise uses Devise for authentication
* "Devise and Pundit and Rails":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-devise-pundit uses Pundit for authorization

h2. Accounts You Will Need

We provide instructions to deploy the tutorial application to "Heroku":https://www.heroku.com/ which provides Rails application hosting. It costs nothing to set up a Heroku account and deploy as many applications as you want. To deploy an app to Heroku, you must have a Heroku account. Visit Heroku "to set up an account":https://id.heroku.com/signup/devcenter.

h2. Dependencies

Before generating your application, you will need:

* The Ruby language - version 2.1.1
* The Rails gem - version 4.1

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html for instructions about setting up Rails and your development environment.

h2. Getting the Application

You have several options for getting the code. You can _fork_, _clone_, or _generate_.

h3. Fork

If you'd like to add features (or bug fixes) to improve the example application, you can fork the GitHub repo and "make pull requests":http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/. Your code contributions are welcome!

h3. Clone

If you want to copy and customize the app with changes that are only useful for your own project, you can clone the GitHub repo. You'll need to search-and-replace the project name throughout the application. You probably should generate the app instead (see below). To clone:

<pre>
$ git clone git://github.com/RailsApps/rails-bootstrap.git
</pre>

You'll need "git":http://git-scm.com/ on your machine. See "Rails and Git":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-git.html.

h3. Generate

If you want to use the project as a starter application, use the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool to generate a new version of the example app. You'll be able to give it your own project name when you generate the app. Generating the application gives you additional options.

To build the example application, Rails 4.1 must be installed in your development environment. Run the command:

<pre>
$ rails new rails-bootstrap -m https://raw.github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer/master/composer.rb
</pre>

The @$@ character indicates a shell prompt; don't include it when you run the command.

This creates a new Rails app named @rails-bootstrap@ on your computer. You can use a different name if you wish.

You'll see a prompt:

<pre>
question  Build a starter application?
      1)  Build a RailsApps example application
      2)  Build a contributed application
      3)  I want to build my own application
</pre>

Enter "1" to select *Build a RailsApps example application*. You'll see a prompt:

<pre>
question  Starter apps for Rails 4.1. More to come.
      1)  learn-rails
      2)  rails-bootstrap
      3)  rails-foundation
      4)  rails-omniauth
      5)  rails-devise
      6)  rails-devise-pundit
</pre>

Choose *rails-bootstrap*. The Rails Composer tool may give you other options (other applications may have been added since these notes were written).

The application generator template will ask you for additional preferences:

<pre>
 question  Web server for development?
       1)  WEBrick (default)
       2)  Thin
       3)  Unicorn
       4)  Puma
       5)  Phusion Passenger (Apache/Nginx)
       6)  Phusion Passenger (Standalone)
 question  Web server for production?
       1)  Same as development
       2)  Thin
       3)  Unicorn
       4)  Puma
       5)  Phusion Passenger (Apache/Nginx)
       6)  Phusion Passenger (Standalone)
 question  Template engine?
       1)  ERB
       2)  Haml
       3)  Slim
 question  Continuous testing?
       1)  None
       2)  Guard
   extras  Set a robots.txt file to ban spiders? (y/n)
   extras  Create a GitHub repository? (y/n)
   extras  Use or create a project-specific rvm gemset? (y/n)
</pre>

h4. Web Servers

We recommend Thin in development for speed and less noise in the log files.

If you plan to deploy to Heroku, select Thin as your production webserver. Unicorn is recommended by Heroku but configuration is more complex.

h4. Template Engine

The example application uses the default "ERB" Rails template engine. Optionally, you can use another template engine, such as Haml or Slim. See instructions for "Haml and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-haml.html.

h4. Other Choices

If you are a beginner, you won't need "continuous testing." If you like to use "Guard":https://github.com/guard/guard, you can select it.

Set a robots.txt file to ban spiders if you want to keep your new site out of Google search results.

It is a good idea to use "RVM":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, and create a project-specific rvm gemset (not available on Windows). See "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html.

If you choose to create a GitHub repository, the generator will prompt you for a GitHub username and password.

h4. Troubleshooting

If you get an error "OpenSSL certificate verify failed" or "Gem::RemoteFetcher::FetchError: SSL_connect" see the article "OpenSSL errors and Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/openssl-certificate-verify-failed.html.

h3. Edit the README

If you're storing the app in a GitHub repository, please edit the README files to add a description of the app and your contact info. If you don't change the README, people will think I am the author of your version of the application.

h2. Getting Started

See the article "Installing Rails":http://railsapps.github.io/installing-rails.html to make sure your development environment is prepared properly.

h3. Use RVM

I recommend using "rvm":https://rvm.io/, the Ruby Version Manager, to create a project-specific gemset for the application. If you generate the application with the Rails Composer tool, you can create a project-specific gemset.

h3. Gems

Here are the gems used by the application:

* "bootstrap-sass":https://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/bootstrap-sass - Bootstrap for CSS and JavaScript
* "high_voltage":https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage - for static pages like "about"

These gems make development easier:

* "better_errors":https://github.com/charliesome/better_errors - helps when things go wrong
* "quiet_assets":https://github.com/evrone/quiet_assets - suppresses distracting messages in the log
* "rails_layout":https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_layout - generates files for an application layout

h3. Install the Required Gems

If you used the "Rails Composer":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/ tool to generate the example app, the application template script has already run the @bundle install@ command.

If not, you should run the @bundle install@ command to install the required gems on your computer:

<pre>
$ bundle install
</pre>

You can check which gems are installed on your computer with:

<pre>
$ gem list
</pre>

Keep in mind that you have installed these gems locally. When you deploy the app to another server, the same gems (and versions) must be available.

h3. Configuration File

To keep some data private, and consolidate configuration settings in a single location, we store credentials in the *config/secrets.yml* file. Include the *config/secrets.yml* file in the *.gitignore* file to prevent the file from being saved in the git repository. See the article "Rails Environment Variables":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-environment-variables.html for more information.

This is the default *config/secrets.yml* file:

<pre>
development:
  secret_key_base: (not shown)
</pre>

The example application does not require any configuration settings. The file *config/secrets.yml* is provided in case you need to customize the application with features that require configuration settings.

All configuration values in the *config/secrets.yml* file are available anywhere in the application as variables. For example, you could add @gmail_username: Your_Username@ and use it as @Rails.application.secrets.gmail_username@ elsewhere in the application. If you wish, you can set each value from an environment variable in the Unix shell. For example, @gmail_username: <%= ENV["GMAIL_USERNAME"] %>@.

h3. Change your Application's Secret Token

If you've used the Rails Composer tool to generate the application, the application's secret token will be unique, just as with any Rails application generated with the @rails new@ command.

However, if you've cloned the application directly from GitHub, it is crucial that you change the application's secret token before deploying your application in production mode. Otherwise, people could change their session information, and potentially access your site without permission. Your secret token should be at least 30 characters long and completely random.

Get a unique secret token:

<pre>
rake secret
</pre>

Edit the *config/secrets.yml* file to change the secret token.

h2. Test the App

You can check that your application runs properly by entering the command:

<pre>
$ rails server
</pre>

To see your application in action, open a browser window and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/":http://localhost:3000.

You should see a home page with a placeholder headline.

You should be able to click the navigation link for "About" and see a placeholder page.

Stop the server with Control-C. If you test the app by starting the web server and then leave the server running while you install new gems, you’ll have to restart the server to see any changes. The same is true for changes to configuration files in the config folder. This can be confusing to new Rails developers because you can change files in the app folders without restarting the server. Stop the server each time after testing and you will avoid this issue.

h2. Deploy to Heroku

For your convenience, here is a "Tutorial for Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-heroku-tutorial.html. Heroku provides low cost, easily configured Rails application hosting.

You'll need to precompile assets before you commit to git and push to Heroku:

<pre>
$ RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "assets compiled for Heroku"
$ git push origin master
</pre>

If you've set configuration values in the *config/secrets.yml* file, you'll need to set them as Heroku environment variables. You can set Heroku environment variables directly with @heroku config:add@. For example:

<pre>
$ heroku config:add GMAIL_USERNAME='myname@gmail.com' GMAIL_PASSWORD='secret'
</pre>

Complete Heroku deployment with:

<pre>
$ git push heroku master
</pre>

See the "Tutorial for Rails on Heroku":http://railsapps.github.io/rails-heroku-tutorial.html for details.
